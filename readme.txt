--Readme document for Emily Melgarejo, melgare2@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
- Multiple pages with navigation between pages: index.html, aboutme.html, projects.html, contact.html
- Images with alt text: my headshot, about photo, pong project screenshot
- Appropriate headings and paragraph text
- External links like LinkedIn and Connect Four Wiki
- Semantic HTML tags

(b) CSS features
- Custom Google Font with fallbacks: Poppins font
- Modified padding for readibility
- Color styling like background, text, buttons
- Responsive layout using flexbox and media queries
- Multi-column list style for my skills in about section

(c) Advanced features
- Contact form using HTML forms
- More complex page layout using a navigation bar and a responsive two-column layout

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
Yes, I had no actual problems but I did have "Potential Problems." I reviewed them, but I felt my site had already dealt with them:
- Alt text warnings: My images use descriptive alt text that matches the content of the images. The checker repeatedly flagged the same image for multiple "may require" checks, but the description is accurate for screen readers.
- Navigation/link text warnings: Navigation links are clear and direct and links like "LinkedIn" and "Resume (PDF)" are also meaningful in context.
- Headings warnings: Headings are used to structure content rather than for visual formatting only.
- Direction/language/sensory checks: The site is written in English (lang="en"), and there are no right-to-left language sections.
- Skip link/sitemap warnings: The site has a consistent navigation bar on every page, which provides a clear way to move through the site.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
It took me around 9 hours to complete this assignment.


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
- https://developer.mozilla.org/ for HTML/CSS reference: forms, flexbox, responsive design
- https://fonts.google.com/ for Google Fonts
- https://www.w3schools.com/ for exploring HTML
- ChatGPT: I used this ai to find the "https://developer.mozilla.org/" website and explain professional colors. My website does have a dark purple background and the ai helped me find that purple. I wanted something cute, but professionalism is important in a portfolio.

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
Jasmine Shields: We consulted each other about ideas for advanced features, validity checking comparison, discussed responsiveness in each others websites, and approaches for structure.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Nope! I would suggest opening index.html in a browser is all - like Chrome or Safari.
