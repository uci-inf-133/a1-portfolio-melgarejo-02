      <h2>Project 1: Connect Four (Python)</h2>
      <p>
        A Connect Four game project where I practiced programming logic and problem-solving. This was one of my first projects,
        it was a playable Connect Four using the console on VSCode.

      <h2>Project 2: Portfolio Website</h2>
      <p>
        A website all about Emily Melgarejo (me) using HTML and CSS. This is my first HTML and CSS project ever, and although it was done for the IN4MATX 133 assignment, 
        it was very fun and I plan on experimenting a lot more.

      <h2>Project 3: Pong (Python)</h2>
      <p>
        A Pong game built in Python where I practiced game logic, movement, and collision detection. This was done for a computer science class - in the game you are able to:
        play, pause, lose, or if you don't lose challenge yourself to get a good high score!
